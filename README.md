# OpenIDM-materials

- The entitlements certification workflow enables the systemadmin user to validate or change the assignments (attribute values only) defined in OpenIDM

- The roles certification workflow allows a manager to review and/or update his reports roles. It features an escalation option as well as the ability to deal with both static and dynamic roles. The dynamic roles inherited by a user can not be edited, since computed by the effectiveRoles.js script, which should be copied to the script/roles project subdirectory.
